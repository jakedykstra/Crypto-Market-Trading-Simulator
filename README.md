Cryptocurrency Simulator
======================

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it helps!

[BlockTrade](https://project2-crypto.herokuapp.com/) is your source for cracking into the crypto market. It's a trade market simulator that gives you an imaginary $10,000.00 to spend in the market to test your luck with. 

### This was built as a UC Davis project group project. We built it out on a SQL database and with a React Front-End to make our currency simulator application better than ever

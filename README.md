Cryptocurrency Simulator
======================

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it helps!

[BlockTrade](https://project2-crypto.herokuapp.com/) is your source for cracking into the crypto market. It's a trade market simulator that gives you an imaginary $10,000.00 to spend in the market to test your luck with. 

### This was built as a UC Davis project group project. We built it out on a SQL database and with a React Front-End to make our currency simulator application better than ever

Sign up for a portfolio with us and play the cyrpto markets without the risk of losing your own money. This is a great application for you to realize your talents when it comes to investing in the markets prior to taking them on for real.

Contributions:
Front-End React was handled by Riley, Dakokta, Jake
Back-End implementation was handled by Aman, Jill and Jake

#### Note: to run the repo you will need the follow:
First fork the files and install dependencies for the server and client package.json by running the following lines in your command line

```
npm i -g
cd client
npm i -g
```

Create a mysql file and link it to our sequelize ORM. We use dotenv here and I would advice you do the same, creating a .env file like below to link to everything. 

```
DB_HOST = yourHostName
DB_PASS = yourDbPassWord
DB_USER = yourDbUserName
```

Now make sure to run your MySQL DB then begin the servers

```
npm run dev 
```
